Built an API in NodeJS using express to send emails using the Gmail API

For the OAuth Client credentials I have not added the clientID and clientSecret in the code as I am not sure whether we can disclose them or not

Also if there's no problem in sharing them then I'll add them to my code and commit changes if required.

Thanks.
